•	Developed Weather Prediction Model to forecast the temperature trends for Seattle based on 6 years of historical weather data.

•	Implemented different machine learning algorithms for regression like Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Gradient Boosting and Logistic Regression with maximum accuracy of 93.77%.

•	Implemented feature reduction to important features and analyzed trade-off between accuracy and run-time if accuracy decreases.
